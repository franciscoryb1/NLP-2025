How to cascade.
If the tile you place your token on has only one animal type on it you can take a nature token. These can be spent on your turn to either replace any of the animal tokens in the display or you can use it to take any combination of tile and token and not just the set ones.
Each animal has its own scoring conditions and you get points depending on those cards. For example, in the set A cards the elks will score for how many and you have in a straight line, the hawks dont want any other hawk adjacent to them and the bears want to be in pairs with no other bears adjacent to them. Lastly youll get one point for each nature token you havent used.
Grin and bear it
Cascadia gives you a lovely combination of things to mull over as you survey the choices of tokens and tiles.
